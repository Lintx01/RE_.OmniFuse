Fig. 3. Overview of the proposed network architecture: (a) Training stage: Inputs with arbitrary missing modality patterns are first encoded using modality-specific encoders, which
are then fed into an imputation network to perform forward imputation of the missing modalities. The completed modalities are dynamically weighted and fused for joint prediction.
Additionally, the embeddings of the imputed missing modalities undergo backward imputation to regenerate the embeddings of the initially available modalities, thereby facilitating
dual-direction supervision through cycle consistency. (b) Inference stage: Only forward imputation is performed to fill in the missing modalities, followed by joint prediction. (c)

ression of training, demonstrating the improving
In this paper, we introduce a novel framework designed to address
the inherent challenges in multimodal learning, particularly within the
medical domain with low-quality data. Traditional methods often strug-
gle with incomplete or missing modalities, which significantly impact
prediction accuracy and robustness. Our framework effectively handles
any combination of missing modalities through autonomous imputa-
tion and employs a dynamic weighted fusion technique that explicitly
quantifies and leverages inter-modality relationships. Additionally, our
approach identifies and activates ‘‘lazy modalities’’, thereby enhancing
overall prediction accuracy and reliability. By dynamically adapting
to changing data scenarios and providing reliable, traceable predic-
tive outputs, our framework represents a significant advancement in
the field of multimodal learning. Experimental validation on MIMIC-
III, MIMIC-IV, and a proprietary lung cancer pathological subtyping
dataset, demonstrates the robustness and versatility of our framework.
A notable design choice in this work is the use of BERT as a fixed
text encoder. Fine-tuning BERT led to poorer results, so we opt to
use it without task-specific adaptation. However, future research could
explore partially fine-tuning BERT or utilizing domain-specific models,
such as Medical BERT, to enhance medical knowledge representation.
While the primary objective of this work is to propose a generaliz-
able and scalable framework, incorporating specialized text encoding
methods may further improve accuracy in specific medical applications.
Future work will also focus on enhancing the scalability and compu-
tational efficiency of our framework, making it suitable for large-scale,
